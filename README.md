# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-IPL-Part-l
Being an ardent cricket fan and sports data analytics student, I have made an effort to make EDA on one of most exciting cricket tournaments. The analysis consists the data of all the IPL matches played from the year 2008 to 2020.

The analysis is done in two parts. First part contains the performance of teams and toss analysis. It informs max wins, win ratio, wins defending and chasing the target to powerplay, middle overs and death overs runs, economy etc.
